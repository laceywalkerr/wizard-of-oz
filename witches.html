                <p>The Good Witch of the South is Glinda the Good. She is the most powerful of the Witches. According
                    to the Soldier with Green
                    Whiskers, Glinda:</p>
                <blockquote> "knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."" — The Wonderful
                    Wizard of Oz, chapter 18, "Away to the
                    South"</blockquote>
                <p>So she was the most beautiful of the four witches. Later books in Baum's Oz series refer to Glinda
                    as a Sorceress, rather
                    than a Witch.</p>
